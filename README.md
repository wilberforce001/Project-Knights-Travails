# Project-Knights-Travails

 Built a function knightMoves that shows the shortest possible way to get from one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way.

 To do this, i used breadth-first search algorithm which works well in finding the shortest path on a graph. By using a breadth-first search algorithm, the function is able to explore all possible moves of the knight while keeping track of positions already visited to avoid cycles and ensuring the shortest path is found. 

 The function is implemented in JavaScript
